## Acknowledgments

TemplateTemplate is written and maintained by [Jason Garber](https://sixtwothree.org/) and is another in a growing collection of small, curiously-named JavaScript utilities:

- [CashCash](https://github.com/jgarber623/CashCash), a very small DOM library inspired by jQuery.
- [RadioRadio](https://github.com/jgarber623/RadioRadio), a very small [PubSub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishâ€“subscribe_pattern) library.
- [RouterRouter](https://github.com/jgarber623/RouterRouter), a very small routing library extracted from [Backbone's Router](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html#section-169).
